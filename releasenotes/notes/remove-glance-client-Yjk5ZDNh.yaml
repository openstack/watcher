    The experimental glance client integration has been removed from Watcher.
    The glance client and create_image_from_instance method became dead code
    after the legacy workflow removal in commit 4179c3527c, which replaced
    the snapshot-based cold migration approach with Nova's native cold
    migration support. This removal eliminates the python-glanceclient
    dependency and glance_client configuration options with no user-facing
    impact.
