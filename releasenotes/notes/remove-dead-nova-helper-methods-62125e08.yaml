    Seven unused methods have been removed from the NovaHelper class.
    These methods had zero production usage and were either remnants from
    old workflows or never integrated into production code. The removed
    methods include delete_instance() (dead since the 2018 workflow
    refactor in commit 4179c352), swap_volume() (removed in 2025 due to
    security concerns), wait_for_instance_status() (unused since 2015),
    get_availability_zone_list(), get_instance_by_name(),
    get_instances_by_node(), and get_service(). This removal eliminates
    approximately 139 lines of dead code and reduces maintenance burden
    with no user-facing impact.
