    Added a pre-condition check to the resize action to prevent executing
    it when required criteria are not met. In following condition,
    the action status will be set to SKIPPED:

    - Instance is not found

    On other condition the action will be FAILED in the pre_condition
    check:

    - Destination flavor does not exist

    This improves safety and correctness of migrations.
