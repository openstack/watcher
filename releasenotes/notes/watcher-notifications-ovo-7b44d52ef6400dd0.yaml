features:
  - Provide a notification mechanism into Watcher that supports versioning.
    Whenever a Watcher object is created, updated or deleted, a versioned
    notification will, if it's relevant, be automatically sent to notify in order
    to allow an event-driven style of architecture within Watcher. Moreover, it
    will also give other services and/or 3rd party software (e.g. monitoring
    solutions or rules engines) the ability to react to such events.
