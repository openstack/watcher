    The decision-engine could move a oneshot audit to ONGOING and start
    execution even when the audit had already been CANCELLED (e.g. before
    it reached ONGOING). The decision-engine now checks the audit state
    immediately before execution, so cancelled audits are no longer
    executed or transitioned to ONGOING.
