    API calls while building the Compute data model will be retried upon
    failure. The amount of failures allowed before giving up and the time before
    reattempting are configurable. The `api_call_retries` and
    `api_query_timeout` parameters in the `[collector]` group can be used to
    adjust these parameters. 10 retries with a 1 second time in between
    reattempts is the default.
