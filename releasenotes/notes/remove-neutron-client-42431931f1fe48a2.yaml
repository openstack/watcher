    The experimental neutron client integration has been removed from Watcher.
    The neutron client and related methods (create_instance,
    get_security_group_id_from_name, get_network_id_from_name) became dead
    code after the legacy workflow removal in commit 4179c3527c. This removal
    eliminates the python-neutronclient dependency and neutron_client
    configuration options with no user-facing impact.
