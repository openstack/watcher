    Currently, the APISchedulingService does not migrate any ongoing
    continuous audits in a failed decision-engine to an alive one when the
    decision-engine dies while the watcher-api is not running.

    This patch fixes those cases by migrating the audits found on a failed
    decision-engine when the watcher-api is started in addition to when a
    change in a decision-engine status is detected.
