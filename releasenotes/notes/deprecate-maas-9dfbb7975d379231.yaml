    The MAAS (Metal as a Service) integration is now deprecated. This feature
    was previously marked as experimental due to lack of testing, maintenance,
    and documentation. The MAAS integration code is planned to be removed in
    a future release, before or together with the removal of eventlet from
    Watcher.
