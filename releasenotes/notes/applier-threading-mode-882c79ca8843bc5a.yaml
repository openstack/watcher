    The Applier service now supports running with ``native threading``
    mode enabled as opposed to the use of the Eventlet library. Note that the
    use of ``native threading`` is still ``experimental``, and is disabled by
    default. It should not be used in production. To switch from Eventlet to
    native threading mode, the environment variable
    ``OS_WATCHER_DISABLE_EVENTLET_PATCHING=true`` needs to be added to the
    applier service configuration. When running in native threading mode, the
    default workflow engine (Taskflow) will be configured with a serial engine,
    which will execute the actions sequentially, due to a limitation of the
    current implementation of watcher services.

    removal <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Eventlet-removal>`__ documentation.
