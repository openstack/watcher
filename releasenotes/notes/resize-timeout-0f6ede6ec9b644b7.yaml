features:
  - |
    Timeout of vm resize operations can be configured applying the
    `migration_max_retries` and `migration_interval` in the `nova`
    section used for migrations. Default values are 180 and 5 seconds.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed the issue when resize actions failed when the resize took more that
    120 seconds. After this patch, the default timeout is 900 seconds (15 minutes)
    which should be a reasonable value for most OpenStack installations.
