    A new service monitor has been added to the applier service to monitor
    the status of the applier services and handle failover for action plans
    when applier services fail. This monitor is executed as part of the applier
    services and performs the following actions when an applier is detected
    as failed:

    - Cancels ONGOING action plans on the failed service.
    - Retriggers PENDING action plans on the failed applier service so that they
      can be picked up by any alive applier service.
