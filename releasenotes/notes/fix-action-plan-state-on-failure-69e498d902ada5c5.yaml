    Previously, if an action failed in an action plan, the state of the
    action plan was reported as SUCCEEDED if the execution of the action has
    finished regardless of the outcome.

    Watcher will now reflect the actual state of all the actions in the plan
    after the execution has finished. If any action has status FAILED, it
    will set the state of the action plan as FAILED. This is the expected
    behavior according to Watcher documentation.
