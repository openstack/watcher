    Added a pre-condition check to the migration action to prevent executing
    migrations when required criteria are not met. In following conditions,
    the action status will be set to SKIPPED:

    - Instance is not found
    - Instance is not running on source node

    On other conditions the action will be FAILED in the pre_condition
    check:

    - Destination node (if specified) does not exists or is disabled
    - Instance is not ACTIVE and migration_type is live.

    This improves safety and correctness of migrations.
