features:
  - |
    A new module, ``watcher.wsgi``, has been added as a place to gather WSGI
    ``application`` objects. This is intended to ease deployment by providing
    a consistent location for these objects. For example, if using uWSGI then
    instead of:

    .. code-block:: ini

       [uwsgi]
        wsgi-file = /bin/watcher-api-wsgi

    You can now use:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [uwsgi]
        module = watcher.wsgi.api:application

    This also simplifies deployment with other WSGI servers that expect module
    paths such as gunicorn.
deprecations:
  - |
    The watcher-api-wsgi console script is deprecated for removal
    in a future release. This artifact is generated using a setup-tools
    extension that is provide by PBR which is also deprecated.
    due to the changes in python packaging this custom extensions
    is planned to be removed form all OpenStack projects in a future
    PBR release in favor of module based wsgi applications entry points.
