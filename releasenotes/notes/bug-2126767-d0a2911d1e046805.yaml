fixes:
  - |
    When running watcher-api as a wsgi server, the decision-engine monitor
    service was not executed so, in a decision-engine failure scenario, the
    continuous audits running on it are not reassigned and are not longer
    running.
    This patch moves the monitor service to the decision-engine so, it will
    be executed as soon as any decision-engine is running.
deprecations:
  - |
    The APISchedulingService has been removed from the Watcher API service.
    It is replaced functionally by the ServiceMonitoringService included
    in the watcher-decision-engine.
features:
  - |
    A leader election mechanism has been added to the ServiceMonitoringService
    so that multiple copies of the decision-engine can be executed simultaneously.
