    When running an audit with the `workload_stabilization` strategy with
    `instance_ram_usage` metric in a deployment with prometheus datasource,
    the host metric for the ram usage was wrongly reported with the incorrect
    unit which lead to incorrect standard deviation and action plans due to the
    application of the wrong scale factor in the algorithm.

    The host ram usage metric is now properly reported in KB when using a
    prometheus datasource and the strategy `workload_stabilization` calculates
    the standard deviation properly.
