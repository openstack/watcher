    Fixed the source_node parameter value in host maintenance strategy migrate
    actions to use node hostname instead of node UUID. This bug only appeared
    during revert of migrate actions, where the revert operation would fail
    because the migration action expected a hostname for the destination
    parameter but received a UUID instead.
