  - |
    The previous collector operation timeout mechanism, which was based on the
    `period` configuration option, has been replaced by a new configuration
    option `compute_resources_collector_timeout`. This new configuration
    option provides more explicit control over the timeout for resource
    collection operations in the Compute Cluster Data Model. Operators
    should review and adjust this new configuration according to their
    environment's needs. Note that collectors `period` configuration didn't
    change and continue to work as before.
