    Host maintenance strategy should migrate servers based on backup node if specified
    or rely on nova scheduler. It was enabling disabled hosts with watcher_disabled
    reason and migrating servers to those nodes. It can impact customer workload. Compute
    nodes were disabled for a reason.

    Host maintenance strategy is fixed now to support migrating servers only on backup
    node or rely on nova scheduler if no backup node is provided.
