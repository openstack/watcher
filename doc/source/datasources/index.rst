Datasources
===========

.. note::
   The Prometheus datasource is deprecated as of the 2026.1 release and will
   be removed in a future release. Use the Aetos datasource instead, which
   provides the same functionality with added multi-tenancy and Keystone
   authentication support. See the :doc:`migrate-prometheus-to-aetos` guide.
